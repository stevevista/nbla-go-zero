# NNabla Tutorial

NNabla's tutorials are provided as [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
where you can run the code step-by-step.

On many Linux (probably on Windows), Jupyter can be easily installed using pip by:

```shell
pip install ipython<=5  # IPython>=6 is not supported in Python<=3.3.
pip install jupyter
```


You can run Jupyter server on your terminal on this folder.

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Then, follow the instruction printed on your terminal to connect the server
on your browser.

Open the `.ipynb` files to start tutorials.
