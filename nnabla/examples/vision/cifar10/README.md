# CIFAR-10 Examples

---

## Overview

The examples listed below demonstrate several deep learning algorithms on CIFAR-10 dataset, which is one of the most popular image classification datasets in the machine learning community. The CIFAR-10 dataset will be automatically downloaded when running any of the examples.

## Multi-Device Multi-Process Training

This example shows the naive `Data Parallel Distributed Training` for the object regognition task using CIFAR-10 dataset and 23-layers ResNet with [NCCL v1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl) using `multi-process`. 

NOTE that if you would like to run this example, please follow the bulid instruction to enable the multi-gpu training and make sure to prepare environment where you can use multiple GPUs. 

When you run the script like the following, 

```
mpirun -n 4 python multi_device_multi_process_classification.py --context "cuda.cudnn" -b 64

```

you can execute the training of 23-layers ResNet in the `Data Parallel Distributed Training` manner with the batch size being 64 and 4 GPUs.

## Multi-Device Multi-Thread Training

This example shows the naive `Data Parallel Distributed Training` for the object regognition task using CIFAR-10 dataset and 23-layers ResNet with [NCCL v1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl) using `multi-process`.

NOTE that if you would like to run this example, please follow the bulid instruction to enable the multi-gpu training and make sure to prepare environment where you can use multiple GPUs.

When you run the script like the following, 

```
python multi_device_multi_thread classification.py --context "cuda.cudnn" -b 64 -n 4

```

you can execute the training of 23-layers ResNet in the `Data Parallel Distributed Training` manner with the batch size being 64 and 4 GPUs.


## Quantized Neural Networks

This example shows the naive `Quantized Neural Networks` (QNN) for the object regognition task using CIFAR-10 dataset and 23-layers ResNet. Currently, `classification_qnn.py` 
contains the following QNNs,

- Binary Connect
- Binary Net
- Binary Weight Network
- Fixed-Point Connect
- Fixed-Point Net
- Pow2 Connect
- Pow2 Net

For example, if you want to use Pow2 Connect, run as 

```
python classification_qnn.py --context "cuda.cudnn" -b 64 -d 0 --net pow2con_resnet23 

```
