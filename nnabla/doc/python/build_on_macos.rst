Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our build system requires:

* `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (>=3.1)
* macOS 10.9 or later
* Clang compilers
* Python 2.7/3.4/3.5/3.6: Tested on Miniconda3.
* Protobuf compiler: Find a binary executable for OS x86_64 architecture at <https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases>. Download and extract the zip file, then locate the binary executable ``protoc`` to the location where path is set.

NOTE: Building with CUDA extension is not supported so far.

Build and installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the requirements described above are set up, the rest of the procedure is exactly same as that in the build on Linux except CUDA installation is not supported on macOS. See :ref:`linux-build-and-install`.
